# trello-bullet-journal-automator
I use this to automate my Trello where I make myself bullet journal to track my productivity using checklist. 

I utitilize Trello API you can check them out in this website: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/

User  must initiate the very first Trello Board, List, Card, and checklist. After that you can run this program it will automatically detect if its time to create the next Board/List/Card/checklist.

I hope you found this helpful!
